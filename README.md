# pymaws: Matsuno Analytical Wave Solution implemented in Python 3
An analytical solutions set for planetary and inertia gravity waves equations based on the work of [Matsuno(1966)](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmsj1965/44/1/44_1_25/_article). These solutions were succsesfully implemented on the [baroclinic wave test case](https://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2018-260/).
